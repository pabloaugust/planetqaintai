  <div class="lyrics">
I look at the world. So many religions and believes. So many wars, so many dying.\
All i want is One love, One Peace, One Unity.\
Why cant that be?

You enter life as baby
An empty page, an empty book
You leave life, written a story
Based on every step you took

Aint life just being a being, arriving, being and then goodbye
Enter the world, breathe in, exist, breathe out, and die (twice)

Each man, each woman, each being follows a line
A path unknown, a risk, a chance, a walk through time
A life determined or undefined
Is there a source of love one has to find

Aint life just being a being, arriving, being and then goodbye
Enter the world, breathe in, exist, breathe out, and die (twice)

Many choices write one’s book
Some are good, some are bad
Each step one makes is written
Each step, one may regret
But a written page can’t be erased
There’s nothing one can do ‘bout that

Aint life just being a being, arriving, being and then goodbye
Enter the world, breathe in, exist, breathe out, and die (twice)
Enter the world, breathe in, exist, breathe out, and die

If you believe, Judgement awaits you, Rasta, Christian, Muslim, Jew or Atheist
Do good and good will come upon you
Or Satan has you on his list

We all are in a large existence
A universe none can define
Believe in love will guide us to it
Religion may guide, you draw the line

Step your steps, jump gaps, relax, live life to the max
Stay proud, live loud, do good, get good love in return
Love burn, your turn to burn hate, let love shine

Each step you take comes from your mind
Take a deep breath and choose the line
Follow the guidelines you believe in
But it is your source you have to find

Aint life just being a being, arriving, being and then goodbye
Enter the world, breathe in, exist, breathe out, and die (twice)

Aint life just being a being, arriving, being and then goodbye
Enter the world, breathe in, exist, breathe out, and die
Enter the world, breathe in, exist, breathe out, and die
Cause life's just being a being, arriving, being and you die
